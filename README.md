Workspace for dynamic Neopixel animations using CircuitPython

To run this code, you'll want a CircuitPython setup.    You'll need to download and install it on your computer,
then download and install the appropriate CircuitPython disk image on the controller.

All the information you need is at https://circuitpython.org/

I've used the MU Editor to do development.   It is an IDE a bit like the Arduino IDE (aware of the hardware connected
go your laptop via a micro-USB cable.

Note, CircuitPython is similar, but DIFFERENT than MicroPython, and the online AIs sometimes mixes up or conflates them.
